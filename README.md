Code for the paper "A Non-Weight Structural Evolution Neural Network for Knowledge Reasoning".

### Enviornment Requirment
  Net Framework4.7 is needed to run NWSE project and Visual studio2019 is needed to view source code.
  
### Experiment reoccurrence
  run NWSEEXperiment.exe, click “Evolution：Run” in toolbar. You can observe the evolution process through the evolution tab (on the right side of the window). The evolution tree and the optima indivuduals of every generation are stored in session directory. The name of session directory starts with "session" and ends with begin time, such as "session20200101120000".
  copy all optima individuals in session directory to path "evaluation", restart NWSEEXperiment.exe and click "evaluation" in toolbar.
  
### How to compare with the methods of paper "Learning Behavior Characterizations for Novelty Search"
  The source code of mazes is come from "Learning Behavior Characterizations for Novelty Search", and have been modified to suit our experiment. To complete the comparasion you need to run the modifiyed version(in path "orgin"), and click "evaulation" in menubar. The results would be stored in path "result".
